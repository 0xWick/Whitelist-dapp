## About

You are launching your NFT collection. You want to give your early supporters access to a whitelist for your collection, so here you are creating a whitelist dapp for your NFT sale (mint).

## Stack

React
Next.js

Solidity (Hardhat)

Vercel

## Requirements (Specific for every dapp)

* Whitelist access should be given to the first 10 users for free who want to get in.
* There should be a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.
